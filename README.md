# CS 3503 BitBoard Checkers Assignment
Definitely more difficult than anticipated.

## Mostly Functional Checkers Game
Unfortunately you will have to type out your moves and select your pieces before moving but regardless fun to play with friends. Does not have a single player mode and is intended to play with another person. Written In only C.


# Build Instructions
Download both main.c, bitboardcheckers.c, and bitboardcheckers.h <br>

'''bash <br>
gcc main.c bitboardcheckers.c -checkers <br>
./checkers <br>
''' <br>

To play this game it prompts you to choose a piece starting with red side <br>
after you choose a piece you it will give you the possible options and if there is a capture available <br>
turns alternate after each move. <br>

You are also able to download the exe file to quickly startup but who trusts an exe file? <br>

i believe it should run good after that.
