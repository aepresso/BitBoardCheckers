#CS 3503 BitBoard Checkers Assignment
Definitely more difficult than anticipated.

## Mostly Functional Checkers Game
Unfortunately you will have to type out your moves and select your pieces before moving but regardless fun to play with friends. Does not have a single player mode and is intended to play with another person. Written In only C.


#Build Instructions
Download both main.c, bitboardcheckers.c, and bitboardcheckers.h <br>

'''bash <br>
gcc main.c bitboardcheckers.c -checkers <br>
./checkers <br>

i believe it should run good after that.
